# Transit Routes Configuration
# Format: type,route,label,stops,min_time,color,commute_hours,days,color2
#
# type: train or bus
# route: CTA route identifier (e.g., "Red" for Red Line, "22" for Bus 22)
# label: Short display name (max 9 chars, e.g., "RedToLoop", "Bus22Nrth")
# stops: Pipe-separated stop IDs (map IDs for trains, stop IDs for buses)
#        Multiple stops = "any of these stations" (shows earliest arrival)
# min_time: Minimum minutes to display (hide arrivals closer than this)
# color: Display color name (e.g., RED, BLUE, ORANGE, etc.)
# commute_hours: Pipe-separated time ranges in 24h format (e.g., "6-9|16-19")
#                Shows only during these hours. Omit or use empty string for always show.
# days: Day filter - "weekday" (Mon-Fri), "weekend" (Sat-Sun), "all" or empty (every day)
#       Can also use specific days as numbers: "0,1,2" (0=Monday, 6=Sunday)
# color2: Optional second color for split rectangle (e.g., PURPLE for Brown/Purple line)
#
# Example configurations:
# train,Red,RedToLoop,40900|41380,3,RED,6-9|16-19,weekday,
# bus,22,Bus22Nrth,1234,5,ORANGE,6-9|16-19,weekday,
# bus,22,Bus22Wknd,1234,5,ORANGE,,weekend,
# train,Brn,Loop,40530,3,BROWN,6-10,weekday,PURPLE  # Brown/Purple split color
#
# Multiple stops example (Red Line northbound from either Howard or Jarvis):
# train,Red,RedNorth,40900|40100,3,RED,,all,
#
# Notes:
# - Times use 24-hour format (0-23)
# - End hour is EXCLUSIVE (6-9 means 6:00-8:59)
# - Empty commute_hours shows route all day
# - Empty or "all" for days shows route every day
# - Empty color2 = single color rectangle (4×6 pixels)
# - color2 specified = split rectangle (2px left color, 2px right color2)
# - min_time prevents "Train arriving in 1 min" clutter when you can't make it
